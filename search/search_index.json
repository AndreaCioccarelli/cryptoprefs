It has a powerful and flexible interface designed to provide unified and simplified primitives to access the Android SharedPreferences system. It offers a consistent syntax for reading and writing values, whilst parameterizing configurations (Auto save policies and Commit strategies) and enabling fine-grained control over the system's behaviour.</p>"},{"location":"#motivation-use-cases","title":"Motivation &amp; Use Cases","text":"<p>The motivation behind KsPrefs stems from the need for a SharedPreferences solution that not only enhances security through cryptography but also streamlines the development process with a clean and intuitive API.

This means you can interact with SharedPreferences using the same syntax regardless of the chosen encryption standard, allowing for a seamless development experience.</p> <p>Customization and Parameterization: Beyond its simplicity, KsPrefs offers extensive customization options. You have the flexibility to parameterize the encryption standard, save policy, and commit strategy, tailoring the library's behavior to suit the specific requirements of your project.</p>"},{"location":"#technical-material","title":"Technical Material","text":"<p>To dive deeper into the technical aspects of KsPrefs, explore the comprehensive set of features, including customizable behavior, encryption options, and extensive support for different data types and enums.</p>"},{"location":"#design","title":"Design","text":"<p>Each kevlar package contains custom implementations for what it has to scan for, but they all share the same overall structure, to make it easy to work with.
